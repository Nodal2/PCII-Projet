# PCII-Projet

The objective of this project was to make a video game inspired by the 80s in which the player controls a racing vehicle whose speed depends on its position in relation to the road. This project was carried out during our 3rd year of computer science license and allowed us to put into practice our knowledge and skills acquired during Concurrent Programming and Interactive Interfaces (PCII).

# How to play ?

The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. The game ends when the player's "remaining time" reaches 0, and that time is continually decreasing. The only way for the player to get time credit is to go through increasingly spaced checkpoints. 

To have time to get to the next point, the player must maintain a high speed. This speed is increased when the vehicle is in contact with the road in the center of the playing field and is decreased when it exits.

Controls : 
- right / left arrows : control the vehicle horizontally
- up arrow : jump to avoid obstacles
